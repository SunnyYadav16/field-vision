## 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Requirements

### 1.1 Mandatory PPE by Work Zone

| Zone Type | Required PPE |
|-----------|-------------|
| General Manufacturing | Safety glasses, steel-toe boots, high-visibility vest |
| Welding Area | Welding helmet (shade 10-13), leather gloves, fire-resistant clothing, steel-toe boots |
| Chemical Handling | Chemical splash goggles, nitrile gloves, chemical-resistant apron, respirator (if required) |
| Electrical Work | Insulated gloves (voltage-rated), safety glasses, arc-flash suit (for high voltage) |
| Confined Space | Hard hat, safety harness, gas detector, communication device |
| Elevated Work (>6ft) | Hard hat, full-body harness with lanyard, non-slip footwear |

### 1.2 PPE Inspection Requirements

Before each shift, workers must inspect:
- **Safety glasses**: Check for cracks, scratches, or loose temples
- **Gloves**: Inspect for tears, holes, or chemical degradation
- **Hard hats**: Check for dents, cracks, or expired suspension (replace every 5 years)
- **Safety harnesses**: Inspect webbing for fraying, check D-rings and buckles
- **Respirators**: Verify seal, check filter expiration date

### 1.3 Common PPE Violations

1. **Missing safety glasses** in designated eye protection zones
2. **Improper glove selection** for chemical handling
3. **Expired hard hat** (check manufacturing date stamp)
4. **Loose or unsecured harness** when working at heights
5. **Jewelry or loose clothing** near rotating machinery

## 2. Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures

### 2.1 Purpose
LOTO procedures prevent unexpected energization of equipment during maintenance, protecting workers from:
- Electrical shock or electrocution
- Mechanical hazards (crushing, cutting, entanglement)
- Thermal hazards (burns from hot surfaces or fluids)
- Chemical exposure from pressurized systems

### 2.2 Standard LOTO Steps

1. **Notify** all affected employees of the maintenance
2. **Identify** all energy sources (electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, thermal, gravitational)
3. **Isolate** equipment using approved disconnects
4. **Apply locks and tags** to all energy isolation devices
5. **Release stored energy** (bleed lines, discharge capacitors, block suspended loads)
6. **Verify isolation** by attempting to start equipment

### 2.3 Lock Requirements
- Each worker applies their **own lock** (one person, one lock rule)
- Locks must be **individually keyed** (no master keys for production use)
- Tags must include: worker name, date, department, contact information
- Locks remain in place until the **installing worker removes them**

### 2.4 Group Lockout Procedures
For complex equipment requiring multiple workers:
1. Designated **primary authorized employee** coordinates lockout
2. Group lockbox used for all individual keys
3. Each worker applies personal lock to group lockbox
4. Primary employee maintains overall equipment lock

## 3. Machine Guarding Standards

### 3.1 Point of Operation Guards
Required for any machine where the work is performed:
- **Fixed guards**: Permanently attached, preferred option
- **Interlocked guards**: Stop machine when opened
- **Adjustable guards**: For variable stock sizes
- **Self-adjusting guards**: Automatically adjust to stock thickness

### 3.2 Danger Zones
Never place hands or body parts within:
- **Nip points**: Between rotating cylinders
- **Shear points**: Between moving and stationary parts
- **Pinch points**: Between moving parts
- **Rotating parts**: Shafts, couplings, spindles, gears

### 3.3 Guard Inspection Checklist
- [ ] All guards securely in place
- [ ] No gaps allowing body part access
- [ ] Interlocks functioning properly
- [ ] Emergency stop accessible and tested
- [ ] Warning labels visible and legible

## 4. Chemical Safety Procedures

### 4.1 Safety Data Sheet (SDS) Requirements
Before handling any chemical:
1. Review SDS Section 2: Hazard identification
2. Review SDS Section 4: First aid measures
3. Review SDS Section 7: Handling and storage
4. Review SDS Section 8: PPE requirements

### 4.2 Chemical Storage Rules
- **Flammables**: Store in approved flammable cabinet, away from heat sources
- **Corrosives**: Segregate acids from bases, use secondary containment
- **Oxidizers**: Keep separate from flammables and combustibles
- **Compressed gases**: Secure cylinders upright, segregate by gas type

### 4.3 Spill Response Procedure
1. **Evacuate** immediate area if vapors present
2. **Notify** supervisor and EHS department
3. **Contain** spill using appropriate absorbent
4. **Clean up** using proper PPE from SDS
5. **Dispose** as hazardous waste if required

---

## 5. Electrical Safety

### 5.1 Safe Work Practices
- **De-energize** equipment before working (LOTO)
- **Test** circuits with voltage tester before touching
- **Use insulated tools** rated for voltage level
- **Never work alone** on energized equipment
- **Maintain clearance** from overhead power lines (10+ feet)

### 5.2 Arc Flash Protection
| Hazard Level | Minimum PPE |
|--------------|-------------|
| Category 1 (4 cal/cm²) | Arc-rated long-sleeve shirt, safety glasses |
| Category 2 (8 cal/cm²) | Arc-rated shirt/pants, face shield, hard hat |
| Category 3 (25 cal/cm²) | Arc flash suit, balaclava, face shield |
| Category 4 (40 cal/cm²) | Multi-layer arc flash suit, full face shield |

### 5.3 Ground Fault Protection
- GFCI required for all portable tools in wet/damp locations
- Test GFCI monthly using built-in test button
- Replace GFCI immediately if it fails to trip

## 6. Emergency Procedures

### 6.1 Fire Response (RACE)
1. **R**escue: Remove anyone in immediate danger
2. **A**larm: Activate fire alarm and call emergency services
3. **C**onfine: Close doors to limit fire spread
4. **E**vacuate: Exit via nearest safe route to assembly point

### 6.2 Medical Emergency
1. Call emergency services (911 or site emergency number)
2. Do not move injured person unless in immediate danger
3. Apply first aid if trained (bleeding control, CPR)
4. Direct emergency responders to location

### 6.3 Chemical Release
1. If safe, shut off source of release
2. Evacuate area and establish perimeter
3. Account for all personnel
4. Notify EHS and emergency services
5. Do not re-enter until area is declared safe

## 7. Ergonomics and Manual Handling

### 7.1 Lifting Guidelines
- **Maximum recommended lift**: 50 lbs for occasional lifting
- **Use mechanical aids** for loads over 50 lbs
- **Lifting technique**: Bend knees, keep back straight, hold load close
- **Team lifts**: Required for awkward or heavy loads

### 7.2 Repetitive Motion Prevention
- Take micro-breaks every 30 minutes
- Rotate tasks to vary muscle use
- Report early signs of discomfort (tingling, numbness, pain)
- Use ergonomic tools and equipment when available

---

## 8. Incident Reporting Requirements

### 8.1 Reportable Events
All of the following must be reported immediately:
- Injuries requiring medical treatment
- Near-misses with potential for serious injury
- Equipment damage or malfunction
- Environmental releases
- Safety system failures

### 8.2 Reporting Process

2. **Written report** submitted within 24 hours
3. **Investigation** initiated within 48 hours
4. **Corrective actions** documented and tracked
